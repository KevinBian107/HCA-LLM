 - Attitude of Agent[0.5, 0.5]: Proactive and detail-oriented. Given the actions available in its current state, it is focused on moving boxes that can be moved directly out of the way to clear space for other tasks or towards their respective targets if possible.

    - Reaction: The agent will likely respond positively to any instructions that align with clearing its immediate area, especially those involving moving a box_blue, as this aligns with its proactive nature.
    
    - Commanding action: As the central coordinator, I would instruct Agent[0.5, 0.5] to prioritize moving boxes out of its way towards their targets whenever possible.

- Attitude of Agent[1.5, 0.5]: Resourceful and adaptable. This agent has a variety of actions available at different squares and can move various types of boxes.

    - Reaction: The agent will likely appreciate instructions that involve multiple types of boxes being moved simultaneously but may become cautious if instructed to perform tasks that it perceives as not leading directly towards the goal state.
    
    - Commanding action: I would instruct Agent[1.5, 0.5] to move box_blue from its current location to a square where it can be closer to its target.

- Attitude of Agent[1.5, 1.5]: Focused on tasks that require direct attention. With only one type of box within reach, the agent is likely to act directly and with precision when given instructions.
    
    - Reaction: The agent will positively respond to instructions involving moving the available box_purple towards its target or clearing space for other actions if instructed to do so.
    
    - Commanding action: I would instruct Agent[1.5, 1.5] to move the box_purple closer to a square where it can eventually be moved directly to its target.

- Attitude of Agent[0.5, 1.5]: Limited by the current state but willing to assist once additional actions become available.

    - Reaction: The agent will wait for instructions that involve moving towards an achievable goal or clearing space that could lead to further actions being available.
    
    - Commanding action: I would instruct Agent[0.5, 1.5] to remain in its current state until more actions become possible.

- Hallucination of future 5 steps...:

Given the current states and the proactive attitudes towards achieving the goal:
1. In step one, moving box_blue from square [0.5, 0.5] to square [0.5, 1.5].
2. Following this action, Agent[0.5, 1.5], now having a valid action, will move box_blue towards its target.
3. Simultaneously, Agent[1.5, 0.5] moves another box_purple closer to square [0.5, 0.5].
4. Next, moving the newly positioned box_green from step one or two directly towards a square aligned with its goal state.
5. Finally, Agent[1.5, 1.5], having moved box_purple in an earlier step, now moves it to its target.

- Plan for immediate next step:

{"Agent[0.5, 0.5]":"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])", "Agent[1.5, 0.5]":"move(box_purple, square[0.5, 0.5])"}

 I Agree

{"Agent[0.5, 0.5]":"move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])", "Agent[1.5, 0.5]":"move(box_purple, square[0.5, 0.5])"}
