# RPLH: A Light-Weight Multi-Collaboration System
Using Language Models' **In-context Learning** abilities, we are developing frameworks for multi-agent collaborations system using Role-Playing Leader-Hellucinating system, or in short, RPLH. We know that as parameter increases, performance automatically increases. However, only limited works have being down on generalizing this sort of in-context learning ability into samll parameter models. In our work, we try to address this issue. We try to design an efficient `light-weight` system that is runable directly on a laptop computer ðŸ’».
