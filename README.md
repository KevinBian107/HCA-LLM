# Role Playing Leader Hellucination (RPLH) Light-Weight Multi-Collaboration System
Using Large Language Models' ***In-context Learning*** abilities, we are developing frameworks for multi-agent collaborations/commetning system using **R**ole-**P**laying **L**eader-**H**ellucinating LLM, or in short, **RPLH**. We know that as parameter increases, performance automatically increases. However, only limited works have being down on generalizing this sort of **in-context** learning ability into samll parameter models. In our work, we try to address this issue. We try to design an efficient `light-weight` system that is runable directly on a laptop computer ðŸ’».
