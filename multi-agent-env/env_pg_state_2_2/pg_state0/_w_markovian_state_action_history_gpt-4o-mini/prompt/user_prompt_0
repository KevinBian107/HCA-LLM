            You are a central planner directing agent in a grid-like field to move colored boxes.
            You are agent at grid [Agent[0.5, 0.5]]. You need to make moves and other agents need to make moves as well.
            
            The goals and rules of this environment are:
            
            You are an agent in a grid-like field to move colored boxes.
            Each agent is assigned to a 1x1 square and can only interact with objects in its area.
            Agents can move a box to a neighboring square or a same-color target.
            You can only move same color boxes to same color targets.
            Each square can contain many targets and boxes.
            The squares are identified by their center coordinates, e.g., square[0.5, 0.5].
            Actions are like: move(box_red, target_red) or move(box_red, square[0.5, 0.5]).
            When planning for action, remanber to not purely repeat the actions but learn why the state changes or remains in a dead loop.
            Avoid being stuck in action loops.
            Additionally, when there is a box still in the grid (i.e. the state space contains {"0.5, 0.5": ["box_red"]}), then the agent in this grid (Agent[0.5, 0.5]) have to make an action in the next step.
            Again, if there is a box in the grid, the corresponding agent in the grid has to make an action in this step.
            Specify your action plan in this format where box_x and box_y are arbitrary boxes: {"Agent[0.5, 0.5]":"move(box_x, square[0.5, 1.5])","Agent[0.5, 1.5]": "move(box_y, target_y)"}.
            One agent can only make one action. Include an agent only if it has a task next. 
            No agent name should be given if the agent does not have a task next. 
            
            
            Your task is to instruct each agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets.
            After each move, agents provide updates for the next sequence of actions.
            You are the central agent and your job is to coordinate the agents optimally.
            
            The previous state and action pairs at each step are: 
            
            Hence, the current state is {'0.5, 0.5': ['box_blue', 'target_blue', 'box_red', 'box_red', 'target_green', 'target_green', 'box_green', 'box_purple', 'target_orange', 'target_orange'], '0.5, 1.5': ['box_red', 'target_red', 'box_red', 'box_red', 'target_red', 'box_green', 'target_purple', 'box_purple', 'target_purple', 'box_orange'], '1.5, 0.5': ['target_red', 'box_green', 'target_green', 'target_green', 'box_purple', 'target_purple', 'box_orange'], '1.5, 1.5': ['target_red', 'target_red', 'box_red', 'target_red', 'box_green', 'box_purple', 'box_purple', 'target_purple', 'target_purple', 'target_purple', 'box_purple', 'box_orange', 'target_orange']}, with the possible that each agent can take: Agent[0.5, 0.5]: I am in square[0.5, 0.5], I can observe ['box_blue', 'target_blue', 'box_red', 'box_red', 'target_green', 'target_green', 'box_green', 'box_purple', 'target_orange', 'target_orange'], I can do one of the following action: ['move(box_blue, square[1.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_blue, square[0.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_blue, target_blue)', 'move(box_red, square[1.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_red, square[1.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_red, square[0.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_green, square[1.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_green, square[0.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_green, target_green)', 'move(box_purple, square[1.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_purple, square[0.5, 1.5])']

            Please only plan actions for each agent that is chosen from each agent's doable action list, do not give a action that is not doable.

            Think about what the future 5 actions would be if you want to achieve the goal with the reasoning.
            Remanber to wirte out for each step, what you plan for every agent to do and what would the state change be.
            
            

            Action Plan:
            Specify your action plan in this format: {"Agent[0.5, 0.5]":"move(box_x, square[0.5, 1.5])","Agent[0.5, 1.5]": "move(box_y, target_y)"} where box_x and box_y are arbitrary boxes.
            Try to propose actions for all four agents.
            One agent can only make one action.
            No agent name should be given if the agent does not have a task next.
