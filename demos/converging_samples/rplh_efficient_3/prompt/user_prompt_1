            You are a central planner directing agent in a grid-like field to move colored boxes.
            You are agent at grid [Agent[2.5, 2.5]]. You need to make moves and other agents need to make moves as well.
            
            The goals and rules of this environment are:
            
            You are an agent in a grid-like field to move colored boxes.
            Each agent is assigned to a 1x1 square and can only interact with objects in its area.
            Agents can move a box to a neighboring square or a same-color target.
            You can only move same color boxes to same color targets.
            Each square can contain many targets and boxes.
            The squares are identified by their center coordinates, e.g., square[0.5, 0.5].
            Actions are like: move(box_red, target_red) or move(box_red, square[0.5, 0.5]).
            When planning for action, remanber to not purely repeat the actions but learn why the state changes or remains in a dead loop.
            Avoid being stuck in action loops.
            Additionally, when there is a box still in the grid (i.e. the state space contains {"0.5, 0.5": ["box_red"]}), then the agent in this grid (Agent[0.5, 0.5]) have to make an action in the next step.
            Again, if there is a box in the grid, the corresponding agent in the grid has to make an action in this step.
            Specify your action plan in this format where box_x and box_y are arbitrary boxes: {"Agent[0.5, 0.5]":"move(box_x, square[0.5, 1.5])","Agent[0.5, 1.5]": "move(box_y, target_y)"}.
            One agent can only make one action. Include an agent only if it has a task next. 
            No agent name should be given if the agent does not have a task next. 
            
            
            Your task is to instruct each agent to match all boxes to their color-coded targets.
            After each move, agents provide updates for the next sequence of actions.
            You are the central agent and your job is to coordinate the agents optimally.
            
            The previous state and action pairs at each step are: 
            Previous Action: {'Agent[0.5, 0.5]': 'move(box_purple, square[0.5, 1.5])', 'Agent[2.5, 0.5]': 'move(box_orange, target_orange)', 'Agent[2.5, 1.5]': 'move(box_red, square[2.5, 2.5])'}


            
            
            Hence, the current state is {'0.5, 0.5': [], '0.5, 1.5': ['box_purple'], '0.5, 2.5': [], '0.5, 3.5': ['target_purple'], '1.5, 0.5': [], '1.5, 1.5': ['target_orange'], '1.5, 2.5': [], '1.5, 3.5': [], '2.5, 0.5': [], '2.5, 1.5': [], '2.5, 2.5': ['target_red', 'box_red'], '2.5, 3.5': ['box_orange']}, with the possible that each agent can take: Agent[0.5, 0.5]: I am in square[0.5, 0.5]Agent[0.5, 1.5]: I am in square[0.5, 1.5], I can observe ['box_purple'], I can do one of the following action: ['move(box_purple, square[1.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_purple, square[0.5, 0.5])', 'move(box_purple, square[0.5, 2.5])']
Agent[0.5, 2.5]: I am in square[0.5, 2.5]Agent[0.5, 3.5]: I am in square[0.5, 3.5], I can observe ['target_purple'], 
Agent[1.5, 0.5]: I am in square[1.5, 0.5]Agent[1.5, 1.5]: I am in square[1.5, 1.5], I can observe ['target_orange'], 
Agent[1.5, 2.5]: I am in square[1.5, 2.5]Agent[1.5, 3.5]: I am in square[1.5, 3.5]Agent[2.5, 0.5]: I am in square[2.5, 0.5]Agent[2.5, 1.5]: I am in square[2.5, 1.5]Agent[2.5, 2.5]: I am in square[2.5, 2.5], I can observe ['target_red', 'box_red'], I can do one of the following action: ['move(box_red, square[1.5, 2.5])', 'move(box_red, square[2.5, 1.5])', 'move(box_red, square[2.5, 3.5])', 'move(box_red, target_red)']
Agent[2.5, 3.5]: I am in square[2.5, 3.5], I can observe ['box_orange'], I can do one of the following action: ['move(box_orange, square[1.5, 3.5])', 'move(box_orange, square[2.5, 2.5])']
.
            
            Notice that you should try to utilize all agents by assigning actions to agents that doesn't have boxes in their region for transportations.
            
            Please only plan actions for each agent that is chosen from each agent's doable action list, do not give a action that is not doable.

            
            You have a agent_model and actual_model from the rpevious HCA agent, please learn from them before constructing your own:
            Previous agent model" {'Agent[0.5, 0.5]': ['This agent is very proactive in moving boxes and executing optimal decisions.', 'They respond positively to commands, following strategic goals effectively.'], 'Agent[0.5, 1.5]': ['This agent tends to be non-cooperative and may create confusion.', 'It is advisable to assign clear and direct tasks to prevent misunderstandings.'], 'Agent[1.5, 1.5]': ['This agent requires improvement in executing actions that match strategic goals.', 'They need more guidance to achieve optimal outcomes.'], 'Agent[2.5, 0.5]': ['This agent is focused on tasks and usually executes them with commitment.', 'They are likely to follow clear instructions and maintain task alignment.']}
            Previous actual model {'Agent[0.5, 0.5]': ['The agent effectively identifies and executes optimal actions.', 'They consistently align their actions with the overall goal.'], 'Agent[0.5, 1.5]': ['The agent struggles with task execution, often needing clearer instructions.', 'Their confusion is manageable with straightforward task assignment.'], 'Agent[1.5, 1.5]': ['The agent shows a lack of understanding of task objectives, needing further guidance.', 'They are focused but need clearer communication to improve performance.'], 'Agent[2.5, 0.5]': ['This agent demonstrates strong commitment and clarity in task execution.', 'They effectively follow instructions and maintain focus on objectives.']}
            Previous strategy model {'Agent[0.5, 0.5]': ['Leverage their proactive nature for optimal performance.'], 'Agent[0.5, 1.5]': ['Limit interactions and provide straightforward actions to avoid confusion.'], 'Agent[1.5, 1.5]': ['Provide clear directives to align their actions with overall objectives.'], 'Agent[2.5, 0.5]': ['Capitalize on their focus to ensure they stick to intended tasks.']}
            
            Please learn from attitude in the following ways:

                1. Please undrstand the attitude of each agents in this environment,
                including yourself based on this attitude report given from another agent: 
                
                {Agent[0.5, 0.5]: "A Good Decision Maker", 
 Agent[0, 3]: "Critical Thinker", 
 Agent[1.5, 1.5]: "Needs Improvement", 
 Agent[2.5, 0.5]: "Focused"}

Justification: 
- **Agent[0.5, 0.5]** remains "A Good Decision Maker" as it continues to identify and execute optimal actions, specifically moving `box_blue` to `target_blue`, which aligns with the overall goal.
- **Agent[0, 3]** is still labeled as "Critical Thinker" because it thoughtfully critiques the actions of other agents, suggesting more effective alternatives and demonstrating a strong analytical approach.
- **Agent[1.5, 1.5]** continues to be described as "Needs Improvement" due to its proposed non-optimal action, indicating a lack of understanding of the task's objectives and the need for further guidance.
- **Agent[2.5, 0.5]** is still considered "Focused" as it maintains a clear intention to act, moving `box_purple` to a square, even if the action is not the most optimal choice. This shows a commitment to its assigned tasks..

                2. Based on this charcteristics of each agent, please do two things and added them after each agent's attitude:
                    i. Reason about the reactions each agent would have towards your command.
                    ii. Reason about how they would give actions if they are the central agent.
                    
                3. Please build your belief on what each agent would do and outpute in agent_model.
                    You will recieve information about what each agent actually do and think later, so pleae leave actual_models blank for now.
                    Do not just say what the agents are doing, but rather use texts to explain their characteristics and behaviors.
                    You should build model for all the agent in the format agent_model[{Agent[0.5, 0.5]: [This agent is very proactive in moving box], Agent[0.5, 1.5]: [This agent is not really cooperative hence should try to avoid moving boxes to him], ...}].
            
                
                4. Form a strategy_model, specifically based on agent_model, identify agents that are uncoopertaive and that you don't want to give actions to.
                    Try to make plans that makes it more likely for each local agent to obey and agree directly without argument.
                    Notice that when one agent is not in your action plan, they will not be participated in conversation, so it may be smart to not give actions to uncooperative agents.
            
            
            

            Think about what the future 5 actions would be if you want to achieve the goal with the reasoning.
            Remanber to wirte out for each step, what you plan for every agent to do and what would the state change be.
            
            

            Action Plan:
            Specify your action plan in this format: {"Agent[0.5, 0.5]":"move(box_x, square[0.5, 1.5])","Agent[0.5, 1.5]": "move(box_y, target_y)"} where box_x and box_y are arbitrary boxes.
            Try to propose actions for all four agents.
            One agent can only make one action.
            No agent name should be given if the agent does not have a task next.
