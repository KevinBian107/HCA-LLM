{"Agent[0.5, 0.5]": "Proactive: good in moving box. Reaction: Likely to follow the command effectively. Reasoning: This agent will optimally move the available box to the best target based on my command.", "Agent[0.5, 1.5]": "This agent is not really cooperative hence should try to avoid moving boxes to him.", "Agent[1.5, 1.5]": "This agent appears to focus on making moves without prioritizing target alignment. Reasoning: This agent may follow my command but could potentially prioritize easy moves over optimal targets. Potential suspect.", "Agent[1.5, 2.5]": "This agent is capable but sometimes focuses on minimal movements. Reasoning: This agent may attempt to comply but might choose a less effective route toward the target if given a chance.", "Agent[2.5, 1.5]": "This agent is observant and tends to support optimal moves. Reasoning: This agent likely will carry out my command effectively and may even suggest optimal moves in the future.", "Agent[1.5, 0.5]": "This agent appears to disrupt plans by suggesting less optimal moves while appearing cooperative."}
