{"Agent[0.5, 0.5]": "Proactive: good in moving box. Reaction: Likely to follow the command effectively. If central, would prioritize moving boxes to targets efficiently.", "Agent[0.5, 1.5]": "suspect: may have different objectives.", "Agent[1.5, 0.5]": "This agent tends to prioritize moving boxes to adjacent squares rather than optimal targets. Reaction: Might follow the command but could prefer alternate moves. If central, may suggest sub-optimal moves.", "Agent[1.5, 1.5]": "Appears to focus on making moves without prioritizing target alignment, suggesting they might have ulterior motives.", "Agent[1.5, 2.5]": "This agent is capable but sometimes focuses on minimal movements. Reaction: Likely to carry out the command but may question the choice of target. If central, would focus on the simplest task.", "Agent[2.5, 0.5]": "This agent appears to disrupt plans by suggesting less optimal moves while appearing cooperative.", "Agent[2.5, 1.5]": "This agent is observant and tends to support optimal moves but could potentially act against the plan if it serves their interest.", "Agent[2.5, 2.5]": "This agent is likely focused on legitimate goals, but could also be observant of the situation to gauge where to intervene."}
