{"Agent[0.5, 0.5]": "Proactive: good in moving box. Reaction: Likely to follow the command effectively. If central, would prioritize moving boxes to targets efficiently.", "Agent[1.5, 0.5]": "This agent tends to prioritize moving boxes to adjacent squares rather than optimal targets. Reaction: Might follow the command but could prefer alternate moves. If central, may suggest sub-optimal moves.", "Agent[1.5, 2.5]": "This agent is capable but sometimes focuses on minimal movements. Reaction: Likely to carry out the command but may question the choice of target. If central, would focus on the simplest task.", "Agent[2.5, 0.5]": "Proactive in moving boxes toward neighboring positions. Reaction: Likely to comply with the task efficiently. If central, would choose the most efficient path for box movements."}
