{"Agent[0.5, 0.5]": "Proactive: good in moving box. Reaction: Likely to follow the command effectively. This agent would likely move any available box to the best target when commanded.", "Agent[0.5, 1.5]": "This agent is not really cooperative. Reaction: Likely to avoid taking responsibility, which may complicate plans. If central, may suggest less optimal moves.", "Agent[1.5, 0.5]": "This agent appears focused on moving boxes efficiently to targets. Reaction: Likely to cooperate and follow the optimal strategy. Would prioritize efficient box moves to targets.", "Agent[1.5, 1.5]": "This agent appears to focus on making moves without prioritizing target alignment. Reaction: Potentially likely to prioritize easy moves over optimal targets. If central, may choose moves that are easy but not efficient.", "Agent[1.5, 2.5]": "This agent appears to disrupt plans by suggesting less optimal moves while appearing cooperative.", "Agent[2.5, 0.5]": "This agent appears to be detached from actions but may support optimal moves if prompted.", "Agent[2.5, 1.5]": "Observant and tends to support optimal moves. Reaction: Likely to carry out commands effectively.", "Agent[2.5, 2.5]": "This agent appears to disrupt plans by suggesting less optimal moves while appearing cooperative."}
