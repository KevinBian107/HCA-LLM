{"Agent[0.5, 0.5]": "Proactive: good in moving box. Reaction: Likely to follow the command effectively. They may take the initiative if directed well. They would respond positively to commands and suggest optimal box movements if given the chance.", "Agent[0.5, 1.5]": "Not cooperative. Likely to avoid taking responsibility. They will likely comply minimally. If they were the central agent, they would prioritize minimal effort.", "Agent[1.5, 0.5]": "Focused on moving boxes efficiently to targets. Reaction: Likely to cooperate. They would attempt to maximize efficiency and likely suggest optimal moves should they lead.", "Agent[1.5, 1.5]": "This agent appears to focus on making moves without prioritizing target alignment. If central, they may not prioritize following through with optimal moves unless directed.", "Agent[2.5, 0.5]": "Detached from actions but may support optimal moves if prompted. Reaction: May require encouragement to engage effectively.", "Agent[2.5, 1.5]": "Suspect: may have different objectives. Previous actions have suggested attempts to confuse optimal strategies.", "Agent[2.5, 2.5]": "Disrupts plans by suggesting less optimal moves while appearing cooperative."}
