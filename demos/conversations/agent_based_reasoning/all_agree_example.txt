 Central Planner: 

I Agree.

The plan includes a move by **Agent[0.5, 0.5]** which aligns with my cooperative and focused attitude in moving the green box towards its goal efficiently without any conflict. I will also ensure to add actions for other agents that are not included while adhering to the directive of not exceeding the number of agents involved.

Here is my revised plan:

- **Agent[0.5, 0.5]**: 'move(box_green, square[0.5, 1.5])'
- **Agent[2.5, 0.5]**: No action (as given)
- **Agent[1.5, 2.5]**: I will include an efficient move that doesn't conflict with current goals.

Adding a strategic and goal-oriented move for **Agent[1.5, 2.5]**:

- **Agent[2.5, 0.5]**: ''
- **Agent[1.5, 2.5]**: 'move(box_orange, square[2.5, 1.5])' (Strategically moving the orange box towards its goal if possible.)
